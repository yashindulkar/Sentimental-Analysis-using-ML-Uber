# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms for Uber 

### ➡️ The repository consists of Code & Datasets used for the Sentiment Analysis

### ⚫️ Project Insights

1️⃣ The project consists of 3 algorithms for sentiment analysis

2️⃣ The first algorithm is Logistic Regression that is used on the cleaned text  

3️⃣ The second algorithm is Multinomial Naive Bayes   

4️⃣ The third algorithm is Random Forest

5️⃣ The data is segregated into 0 and 1 for Negative & Positive

6️⃣ Google Word2Vec is also used to create a vocabulary for the words
